The solution involves improving error handling and managing asynchronous operations more effectively within the custom native module.  This might include using promises or async/await to handle asynchronous tasks and adding more detailed logging to pinpoint where things are going wrong.  Thorough testing with various devices and Expo Go versions is crucial for improving stability.  Also review and ensure your native module correctly handles permission requests and any potential race conditions that could lead to unexpected behavior.
