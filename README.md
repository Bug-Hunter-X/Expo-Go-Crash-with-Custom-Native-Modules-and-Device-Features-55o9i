# Expo Go Crash with Custom Native Modules and Device Features

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo Go where using a custom native module to access device features (like the camera or GPS) can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. The issue is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently. 

## Bug Description

The Expo Go app crashes or behaves unexpectedly when interacting with a custom native module that tries to utilize device-specific capabilities. This problem is particularly noticeable on certain devices and is not always reproducible across all platforms.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (`npm install`).
3. Run the app using Expo Go (`expo start`).
4. Observe the crashes or unexpected behavior when using the relevant features.

## Potential Solutions

This repo contains a potential solution aimed at fixing the Expo Go instability caused by using a native module. The bug might stem from several factors:

* **Asynchronous operations:**  Improper handling of asynchronous operations in the native module could disrupt its interactions with Expo Go.
* **Permission issues:** The app might not have the necessary permissions to access the desired device features.
* **Native module incompatibility:** The native module might have compatibility issues with specific versions of Expo Go or React Native.

## Solution Details

The solution provided focuses on robust error handling and more careful management of asynchronous operations within the native module to minimize disruptions. It also provides a more controlled way to handle permission requests.
